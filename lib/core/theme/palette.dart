/// The prototype's palette — its `:root` custom properties (`index.html:9-10`),
/// ported once so they stop being re-declared per screen.
///
/// **Why this is a port of a real artifact and not a speculative helper.** This
/// plan has twice refused to add a constant nothing calls yet (`usingDemoKey`,
/// `isCloseFlyby`), and that rule still holds — but it is about *inventing* an
/// abstraction the prototype does not have. A `:root` block is the opposite:
/// the prototype already decided these eleven colours are the shared, named,
/// reused ones, and gave each a name. Porting it whole is the same call
/// `kNamePool` and `kFallbackAsteroids` made — the table is the prototype's, so
/// it comes across intact rather than sampled down to today's call sites.
///
/// **What is deliberately *not* here: one-off literals.** Most colours in
/// `index.html` are not variables. The radar's ring strokes, Earth's gradient
/// stops, and the spinner's track each appear exactly once and stay local to the
/// widget that draws them; hoisting them would invent a relationship the
/// prototype does not have (see the note in `radar_painter.dart`). The test for
/// membership here is that the prototype named it, not that two Dart files
/// happen to want it.
///
/// **Two of the eleven are dead and are not ported**, per the plan's
/// decision 1 ("do not port the prototype's dead state"): `--navy` (`#0B1F3A`)
/// and `--card2` (`#0f2242`) are declared on lines 9-10 and then referenced
/// nowhere — not by `var()`, not by a raw hex, not in the JS, not in
/// `title.html`. Verified rather than assumed; every other variable below
/// carries its live use count for the same reason. If a later screen genuinely
/// needs a second card shade, `--card2` can be resurrected *then*, with a
/// consumer to justify it.
///
/// The `ColorScheme` mapping proper is still open — see `main.dart`, which pins
/// only the two entries the prototype answers outright.
